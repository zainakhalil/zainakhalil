# Hi, I’m Zaina Khalil 🌍

I’m a **Data Science student at UIC** (CS concentration) passionate about using data, language, and technology to create meaningful impact. My work spans **fine-tuning transformer models for financial risk analysis**, **cleaning and modeling large-scale datasets**, and exploring **satellite intelligence with foundation models**.  

Alongside studies, I serve as a **Senior Peer Mentor** and **President of Islamic Relief @ UIC**, blending technical skills with leadership and community engagement. For me, data isn’t just numbers—it’s about asking *who benefits* and *what changes* when insights turn into action.  

Outside of code, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen 🍴, traveling ✈️, and exploring the intersections of culture, faith, and language 🕌.
