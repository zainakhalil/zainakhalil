# Hi, I’m Zaina Khalil 🌍

I’m a Data Science student at UIC with a curiosity for patterns in language, behavior, and data. I love exploring how technology can make systems clearer and help communities thrive. My work ranges from cleaning and modeling complex datasets to applying machine learning and NLP to solve practical problems.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually experimenting in the kitchen 🍴, traveling ✈️, or thinking about the connections between culture, language, and faith 🕌. I care about who benefits from data and what changes it can make, whether that’s through research, mentorship, or community initiatives.
