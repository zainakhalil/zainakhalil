# Hi, I’m Zaina Khalil 🌍

I’m a Data Science student at UIC with a concentration in Computer Science, interested in how data, language, and technology can be used to make systems more transparent and communities more supported. My projects range from fine-tuning transformer models for financial risk analysis to cleaning and modeling large-scale industry datasets that guide decision-making.

Alongside my studies, I serve as a Senior Peer Mentor and President of Islamic Relief @ UIC, where I work on building supportive spaces and organizing initiatives that connect people to resources and impact. For me, data science isn’t just about numbers—it’s about asking who benefits and what changes when insights turn into action.

Outside of code and research, you’ll usually find me in the kitchen experimenting with recipes 🍴, traveling ✈️, or exploring the connections between culture, faith, and language 🕌.
